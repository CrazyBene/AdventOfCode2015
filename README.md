These are my solution to the Advent of Code[^aoc-footnote] puzzles of 2015. I know, that I am a little late for this

I am doing all my solutions in Kotlin (again), but I am trying out a new, experimental build tool called [Amper][amper]
from Jetbrains.

[^aoc-footnote]:
[Advent of Code][aoc] – An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for
twenty-five days.
